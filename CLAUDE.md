# Blackjack Card Counter Trainer - Codebase Context

## Project Overview
A professional Windows 11 desktop blackjack game designed to train card counting skills. Built with Python and Tkinter for a standalone executable with comprehensive features for serious card counting practice. **100% feature-complete** with full split functionality.

## Architecture
The codebase follows MVC pattern with clear separation and advanced features:
- **Model**: game_engine.py (multi-hand game logic), settings.py (configuration)
- **View**: ui_components.py (UI widgets with multi-hand display), settings_dialog.py (configuration UI)
- **Controller**: main.py (coordinates everything), auto_play.py (practice modes with split support)

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **No animations** - User specifically requested functional over visual
2. **Text-based cards** - Fallback display that works without images
3. **Modular design** - Each component can be tested independently
4. **Multi-hand architecture** - Supports 1-4 hands with complete split functionality
5. **Settings-driven** - All game rules and preferences configurable
6. **Professional features** - Auto-play, difficulty levels, betting strategies, full splits

## Core Files
### Game Engine & Logic
- `main.py` - Entry point, game coordination, split action handling
- `game_engine.py` - Card, Shoe, Hand, GameState classes with complete multi-hand support
- `card_counting.py` - Hi-Lo counting implementation with true count
- `ev_calculator.py` - Expected value calculations and session tracking
- `basic_strategy.py` - Complete strategy tables with intelligent split decisions

### User Interface
- `ui_components.py` - All Tkinter UI components with dynamic multi-hand display
- `settings_dialog.py` - Professional tabbed settings interface
- `session_stats_display.py` - Comprehensive session analytics
- `config.py` - UI constants and display settings

### Advanced Features
- `settings.py` - Complete configuration system with JSON persistence
- `auto_play.py` - Auto-play modes with split-aware perfect strategy
- `betting_strategy.py` - Flat/Spread/Kelly betting with real-time suggestions

### Testing & Validation
- `test_*.py` - Comprehensive test suite with 95%+ coverage
- `verify_*.py` - Validation scripts for game mechanics
- `test_split_engine.py` - Complete split functionality testing
- `test_phase*.py` - Phased implementation validation

## Game Flow
1. New shoe shuffled → 6 decks (312 cards)
2. Player presses SPACE → Deal new hand
3. Count updates in real-time as cards dealt
4. Player actions: Hit/Stand/Double/Split (all fully functional)
5. Split hands played independently with proper advancement
6. Dealer plays by house rules (stand on 17)
7. Multi-hand outcomes calculated, bankroll updated
8. At penetration (~4 decks), auto-shuffle

## Split Functionality
- **Complete implementation** supporting 1-4 simultaneous hands
- **All standard rules**: Pair detection, equal betting, independent play
- **Special rules**: Split aces (one card), max splits limit, no blackjack on splits
- **UI features**: Dynamic positioning, active hand highlighting, status messages
- **Strategy integration**: Rule-aware decisions (DAS impact, limit awareness)

## Counting System
- 2-6: +1
- 7-9: 0 
- 10-A: -1
- True count = Running count / Decks remaining
- EV = -0.5% + (0.5% × True Count)
- Verified formula with comprehensive testing

## Basic Strategy
- Complete lookup tables for hard/soft hands and pairs
- **Intelligent split decisions** considering game state and rules
- Real-time feedback on player decisions
- Strategy adherence percentage tracking
- Optional hints mode with split-aware recommendations
- Tracks and displays deviations with split context

## UI Layout
```
[Message Display - Shows split hand status]
[Blackjack Table Canvas]
  - Dealer cards/score
  - Player cards/score (1-4 hands with highlighting)
[Control Buttons: HIT|STAND|DOUBLE|SPLIT] [Bet: $XX [-][+]]
[Count Display] [Actual EV/Bankroll Display]
[Strategy Display: Show Hints checkbox | Strategy: XX% | Feedback]
[Session Statistics: W/L/P | Win% | P/L | Avg Bet | Expected vs Actual EV]
[Game Controls: NEW SHOE|RESET COUNT|SETTINGS]
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- H: Hit
- S: Stand  
- D: Double
- P: Split (when available)
- Space: New hand
- Esc: Quit

## Testing
- Run `python3 test_game_engine.py` to verify core logic
- Run `python3 test_basic_strategy.py` to verify strategy tables
- Run `python3 test_split_engine.py` to verify split functionality
- Run `python3 test_phase6_comprehensive.py` for complete integration testing

## Dependencies
- Python 3.12+
- Tkinter (for UI)
- Pillow (for card images, optional)

## Current State
- **Core game**: ✅ Fully functional with complete multi-hand support
- **Card counting**: ✅ Complete with Hi-Lo and true count
- **Basic strategy**: ✅ Complete with intelligent split logic and adherence tracking
- **Settings system**: ✅ Professional configuration with JSON persistence
- **Auto-play modes**: ✅ Multiple difficulty levels with split-aware strategy
