# Quick Fix Guide

## Display Cut-off Issue - FIXED! ‚úÖ

The window height has been increased from 800 to 900 pixels. Just restart the game:
```
python main.py
```

The window is now also resizable, so you can drag the edges if needed!

## Check Your Dependencies

Run this command to check what's installed:
```
python check_dependencies.py
```

Or check manually:

### Check Tkinter:
```
python -c "import tkinter; print('Tkinter OK')"
```

### Check Pillow:
```
python -c "import PIL; print('Pillow OK')"
```

## Install Missing Dependencies

### Install Tkinter (REQUIRED):
- **Windows**: Reinstall Python from python.org and CHECK "tcl/tk and IDLE"
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- **Mac**: `brew install python-tk`

### Install Pillow (Optional, for better cards):
```
pip install Pillow
```
or
```
python -m pip install Pillow
```
